## This JS repo will restore your faith in closures.

Rewrite closures and scoping rules **from scratch.** Entirely in JavaScript. Using **prototypal inheritance,** some clever **hat-tips from graphics programming,** amnesic **function bodies,** and this **one weird global variable.**

## Convert code to closure-less equivalent

To convert some regular JavaScript to the closure-less version demoed, go to https://nybblr.github.io/closures/ and drop in some code.

Note that it is **extremely** limited and won't handle any edge cases (e.g. multiple var declarations per line, function declarations, etc.)
